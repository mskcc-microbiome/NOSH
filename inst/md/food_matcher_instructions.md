### Categorize Custom Foods
The purpose of this module is to associate a FNDDS food ID and FNDDS food portion with custom foods. The table below shows all the raw food ID's that do not have already have an FNDDS annotation recorded in [REDCap][https://redcap.mskcc.org/redcap_v13.7.31/ProjectSetup/index.php?pid=4280].

1. Click on one of the rows (or start from scratch!)
2. Select for the appropriate FNDDS food in the `FNDDS Code and Description` column.  NFS mean "Not Further Specified".  Selecting an entry should populate the next two fields.
3. Select the most convenient portion in the `FNDDS Portion Size` drop down
4. Determine how many `Raw Food Unit Conversion` are needed to equal the selected `FNDDS Portion Size`. For example, if the Computrition cheddar serving is an 1oz, and you have selected "1 8oz cup" in the FNDDS `Portion Size` dropdown, enter "8" as the `Raw Food Unit Conversion`.
